 * lodash-ish function that's like debounce + (throttle w/ async handling) combined.
 *
 * Requires a lot of callbacks to meaningfully turn a red function into a blue one, but you *can* do it!
 * Note that part of this is emulating the fact that the sync handler cannot have a return value,
 * so you'll need to use `setResolve` and the other related functions to do that in whatever way works for your specific scenario.
 *
 * The comments are numbered in approximate execution order for your reading pleasure (1 is near the bottom).
