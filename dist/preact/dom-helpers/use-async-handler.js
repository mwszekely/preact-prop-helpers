/**
 * Given an asynchronous event handler, returns a synchronous one that works on the DOM,
 * along with some other information related to the current state.
 * Does not modify any props.
 *
 * @remarks Note that because the handler you provide may be called with a delay, and
 * because the `value` of, e.g., an `<input>` element will likely have changed by the
 * time the delay is over, a `capture` function is necessary in order to
 * save the relevant information from the DOM at call-time. Any other simple event data,
 * like `mouseX` or `shiftKey` can stay on the event itself and don't
 * need to be captured &ndash; it's never stale.
 *
 * The handler is automatically throttled to only run one at a time.
 * If the handler is called, and then before it finishes, is called again,
 * it will be put on hold until the current one finishes, at which point
 * the second one will run.  If the handler is called a third time before
 * the first has finished, it will *replace* the second, so only the most
 * recently called iteration of the handler will run.
 *
 *
 * You may optionally *also* specify debounce and throttle parameters that wait until the
 * synchronous handler has not been called for the specified number of
 * milliseconds, at which point we *actually* run the asynchronous handler
 * according to the logic in the previous paragraph. This is in
 * *addition* to throttling the handler, and does not replace that behavior.
 *
 *
 * @example
 * General use
 * ```tsx
 * const asyncHandler = async (value: number, e: Event) => {
 *     [...] // Ex. send to a server and setState when done
 * };
 * const {
 *     // A sync version of asyncHandler
 *     syncHandler,
 *     // True while the handler is running
 *     pending,
 *     // The error thrown, if any
 *     error,
 *     // Show this value while the operation's pending
 *     currentCapture,
 *     // And others, see `UseAsyncHandlerReturnType`
 *     ...rest
 * } = useAsyncHandler<HTMLInputElement>()({
 *     asyncHandler,
 *     // Pass in the capture function that saves event data
 *     // from being stale.
 *     capture: e => {
 *         // `capture` can have side-effects because
 *         // it's called exactly once per invocation
 *         e.preventDefault();
 *
 *         // Save this value so that it's never stale
 *         return e.currentTarget.valueAsNumber;
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * const onInput = pending? null : syncHandler;
 * ```
 *
 * {@include } {@link UseAsyncHandlerParameters}
 *
 * @see useAsync A more general version of this hook that can work with any type of handler, not just DOM event handlers.
 *
 * #__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__
